Parking:    Parking in the North End of Boston: The North End of Boston is one of Boston oldest neighborhoods - filled with cafes, restaurants, and moms and pops shops. The streets are narrow and often you will find cars double-parked while people greet each other or grab a cup of cappuccino from the now famous Mike’s pastry on Hanover St. Things to remember about parking: •The best place to park without paying is in a visitor’s space  on Hanover Street.    Pay attention to the signs because some are from 8am-6pm and some are 12pm –6pm.  Free parking is limited usually to two hours and is often enforced. The area is very popular with tourists, so it may take time to find free parking. •Metered parking is usually available all along Commercial Street, which runs perpendicular to Hanover Street.

As home to over eighty restaurants and countless wine shops, bakeries, and Italian salumerias (a.k.a Italian delis) it is safe to say you won’t leave hungry!     As noted above there is plenty to do just in the North End but the beauty of the location you are minutes away to downtown Boston. Mostly all within walking distance and what  Isn't is very easily accessible by public transportation which is just a minute walk from the apartment . You can shop for food and cook at the apartment or there is plenty to choose from if you don't want to cook. Also the neighborhood is the safest neighborhood in Boston",We will make your stay very memorable . You will have complete privacy but also feel part of the neighborhood.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Pay attention to the signs because some are from 8am-6pm and some are 12pm –6pm.  Free parking is limited usually to two hours and is often enforced. The area is very popular with tourists, so it may take time to find free parking. •	Metered parking is usually available all along Commercial Street, which runs perpendicular to Hanover Street.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

Prior to my current job at an investment consulting and advisory firm, where I focus on identifying top-tier real estate managers for our clients to invest in, I worked for a small firm managing a Saudi Prince's hotel investments across North America and Europe.  We managed his interests in the Four Seasons and Fairmont management/operating companies, as well as oversaw his investments in several trophy properties, most notably, NYC's The Plaza, A Fairmont Managed Hotel; The Fairmont San Francisco; Paris' Four Seasons Hotel George V; and London's The Savoy, A Fairmont Managed Hotel.  I have taken the same approach we took at my previous firm to managing our personal real estate investments, by providing exceptional service combined with fantastic accommodations in prime locations.

The area is very popular with tourists, so it may take time to find free parking. •	Metered parking is usually available all along Commercial Street, which runs perpendicular to Hanover Street.
